# A Real World Application using Neo4j

## (For CSC5425 - "Advanced Database Systems")

### Assignment 4

This is my submission for [Assignment 4 -Neo4J assignment](https://csc.mc.edu/moodle/mod/assign/view.php?id=12753). The development OS was Linux Mint 20.3 (x86_64), Cinnamon version, running Kernel version 5.4.0.

To run it, you must first install neo4j; I installed it from a tarball following the instructions here: <https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/linux/tarball/>. After starting the neo4j daemon using the `sudo /opt/neo4j/bin/neo4j start` command (assuming you did, indeed, install from a tarball), opening the web GUI, and changing the default password, run `install_RW_proj.pl`.
